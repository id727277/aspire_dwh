### DWH on SQLite

This repo contains sample python and sql scripts developed for a local company. The main goal was to create a DWH using SQLite and develop reports with PowerBi to replace the existing Excel reports for the senior management. The company was not ready to provide server for regular client-server database like Postgres or SqlServer nor to spent money on any existing solution for analytics

Sql folder contains scripts for moving data between layers of warehouse and creating reports. Python folder contains example of gathering data from website and some other functions.
